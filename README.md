# To update this material...

1. Update the project code
2. Update the feedback form, if applicable
3. Update StackBlitz project with the newest code (easiest way is to edit or clone the existing StackBlitz, and drag/drop the new files into the project. The StackBlitz URL should remain the same, but double check that it still works.)
4. Commit to main, and deploy to GitHub Pages
