# Notes for updating this material

To update this material...
1. Update the project code
2. Update the feedback form, if applicable
3. Update StackBlitz project with the newest code (easiest way is to edit or clone the existing StackBlitz, and drag/drop the new files into the project. The StackBlitz URL should remain the same, but double check that it still works.)
4. Commit to main, and deploy to GitHub Pages

Other important notes
- The StackBlitz project used is not the default Angular template, as there is no way to open a terminal tab in the default Angular template
- StackBlitz limits the total size of the uploaded project to around 1MB. As the biggest files in the code base are the included images, images in 'Angular & GitHub Pages' are sourced directly from the GitHub repo to save on assets needed to be uploaded to StackBlitz. Images in 'Angular Basics' are sourced from uploaded assets, as participants are directed to follow that implementation to include another image.
